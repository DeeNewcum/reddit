This is a group of basic shell-scripts that let you 1) download all comments that one Redditor has made, and 2) search through that user's comments in various ways.

These are somewhat rough, they're pretty much just used by me, but they might be useful to others.


## Installation

To install the dependencies for these scripts, you should:

    sudo apt-get install perl cpanminus
    cpanm  LWP  JSON::XS  Getopt::Casual
